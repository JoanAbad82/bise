// project's items, opened in place by ⌘I, /inbox, a notification or the
// capsule (openInbox); there is no inbox screen. InboxCard.tsx is one item as
// a card (the capsule's bottom cards mount it alone, amb-web); model.ts is its
// state and keys, order.ts its order (the hub's rank), stripRows.ts the
// block's rows and keys.
