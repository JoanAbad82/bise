// The sends slice of the window's machine (fast-try p4 slice 2, architect m_30501): his messages
// on their way and how they settle, as step(state, facts, input) -> [state, outputs]. What it holds
// is the window's own: each thread's rows of his messages not echoed yet (sending, or failed with
// why) and the ids of his messages that landed before their send's answer. How a row settles is
// the hub's to say, read with echo.ts's rules, never one of its own: turn/send's result gives the
// row its message id (A1, main's window-local 'sent'), his 'you' entry with that id (or a page
// holding it) takes it away, the send's error with its cid fails it (refused) or takes it away
// (undelivered: the hub's entry stands in), and the core going down (HubFacts.core) fails every
// row still on its way. A send while the core is down sends nothing and fails at once.
// Kept as today, with its end: 'sends-oldest' (an error without a cid fails the project's oldest
// row on its way: no path without a cid was found, architect m_30504). Its deletion, with feature
// test 7 rewritten (architect m_30540), waits until fast-try's p4 resumes (paused after slice 2 by
// Gabriel's word: no new refactors).
// An input that changes nothing gives the same state back and no output. Pure. Owner: amb-core.
