//! The hero area's UI words (see [`super`]: the rules, how to read
//! them): the permanent hero card at the top of each of the desktop's full
//! pages (apps/desktop/src/ds/pagehero.tsx), its sentence (what the place
//! is, in his words) and its facts line (live numbers). Words from
//! designer's m_39021 (page page-hero, docs/brand/design-system.md
//! 'dialogs and page heroes'); the settings sections' sentences are their
//! `settings.page_*_sub`. Ages (`2 h`) and clock times stay TS fns.
