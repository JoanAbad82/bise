//! The hub's client snapshot, typed (issue 30): what `core::Hub::snapshot`
//! returns (built in core_snapshot.rs, its agent rows in snapshot_rows.rs)
//! and what the views read by field: the typed rows (proto_view), the
//! growth rows, view.json.
//!
//! The hub's view, not wire, and never sent: the wire rows stay
//! bise_proto's (`rows::Agent`, `rows::Card`...), mapped from these by
//! proto_view. The hub builds the core of it (agents, cards, places,
//! flow); the shell fills the rest, one writer per area (daemon.rs
//! `snapshot`: the pages, the cards' page links, the agents' models).
